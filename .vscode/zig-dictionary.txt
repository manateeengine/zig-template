# Zig doesn't have official support in cSpell (not as of July 2024 anyway), however we really enjoy
# having proper spelling in our codebase. To get around this, we include this file to act as a Zig
# dictionary for cSpell. Once this is built out a little bit more, we'll likely open a PR with
# cSpell to make it official!
